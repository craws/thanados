                <b> "Medieval Cemeteries at the Periphery of the Carolingian World" </b> was developed within the
                Project
                "International exchange of methodological
                experience in the study on the impact of emergencies on the migration and economic strategies of the
                past
                human populations" (Project No.:
                CZ.02.2.69 / 0.0 / 0.0 / 16_027 / 0008494). It is funded by the European Union and the Ministry of
                Education,
                Youth and
                Sports of the Czech Republic. It deals with the digital dissemination of Early Medieval graveyards and
                aims
                at creating an online platform for interactive publishing of archaeological data. All information of the
                archaeologically investigated sites presented here comes from the original publications and is
                represented
                as digital catalog along with interactive maps and visualisations of the cemeteries.
