                <b> Beneath the fields and forests of Austria the remains of thousands of medieval villages still exist,
                    abandoned by their inhabitants due to various reasons. Despite a long research history, there is
                    little known about their internal structure, period of use and the exact causes of abandonment. Only
                    a few geophysical surveys of such deserted villages in Austria have been conducted to date, yet, the
                    intensification of agriculture is destroying preserved archaeological remains at an increasing rate.
                    <br><br>
                    The objective of the project 'Medieval Deserted Villages [MDV]' is the extensive and
                    detailed
                    documentation and investigation of deserted villages in a larger historic landscape context, before
                    the
                    irrevocable loss of this rich cultural heritage. The main research questions are concerned with the
                    localisation of further villages, the identification
                    of certain causes of abandonment as well as the study of their internal structure and organisation.
                    It will be attempted to derive stratigraphic
                    sequences of different settlement phases, which might support or contradict previous theories on the
                    development of medieval settlements. The archaeological prospection of entire villages and their
                    surroundings will also yield more information about their economic basis and their historical road
                    network.
                    <br><br>

                    The project follows a multidisciplinary research approach: The large-area mapping of the
                    physical remains of entire medieval deserted villages will combine geophysical ground penetrating
                    radar and magnetic surveys with the analysis of existing aerial images and airborne laser scanning
                    data. The data is analysed in depth together with written sources and historic maps, using a
                    geographical information system. The derived interpretation maps and the acquired written sources
                    are in and disseminated with the web-based database system OpenAtlas.
                    <br><br>
                    The main innovative aspect of the project lies in a better understanding of medieval villages in
                    respect to their environment and historical development, based on novel prospection approaches. The
                    results will be made available open access via OpenAtlas over a web interface, also allowing for
                    advanced queries and further analyses of the data. The project outcome and collected data will thus
                    be of further benefit for research on medieval rural settlements and peasant societies in general,
                    which have often been neglected in historical research so far compared to urban structures and
                    aristocratic life due to the nature of recorded written sources.
