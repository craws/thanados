                    <p>
                        If you filter by <b>timespan</b> you can define the minimum and maximum
                        years (CE). For years before year 0 just prepend a minus " - " to the
                        number.

                            E.g. a search for all burials that have a "sex" property would result in

                        Thus only a deviation ranging from 0 to 180 degrees is given here.
                        The azimuth is automatically calculated using PostGIS

                            of. You can also define a minimum and maximum (weight percentage) like
                            between 90% and 100% copper that the respective entity should have.
                        </li>

                        category in your search results. E.g. choosing "Attack Weapons" in the
                        "maintype" selection for finds will also include all entries
                        like "Swords", "Arrowheads" etc. for your search result.

                    <p>
                        If you filter by <b>timespan</b> you can define the minimum and maximum
                        years (CE). For years before year 0 just prepend a minus " - " to the
                        number.

                        can be chosen to expand respectively narrow your search. After choosing one
                        option a new search will start and depending on the option do the following:
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            <b>And</b> takes the result as a base and searches for the new
                            parameters in this dataset. This will be an intersection of both
                            results:
                            If you search on the find level both times, once for crescent shaped
                            temple rings and then for finds that have at least 80% of copper as
                            material this will result in all finds classified as crescent shaped
                            temple ring (or subcategories of this) that are produced of 80%
                            copper or more.
                            When combining different search levels this intersection shows you,
                            depending on the direction, either results from the lower level that
                            were found in results of the higher level respectively results from
                            the higher level that contain results from the lower level. E.g. if
                            you take the result for "graves" with "multiple burials" and combine
                            it with a search for "finds" that are "attack weapons" you will get
                            all weapons that were found in graves with multiple burials.
                            The other way round you would get all graves with multiple burials
                            that contain weapons.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Or</b> takes the result as a base and adds the result for the new
                            parameters to this dataset.
                            This way you can for example search for different types of finds and
                            combine them in one map. E.g. all occurrences of finds with the
                            main types "jewelry" along with all finds of the maintype "seax".
                            You can also mix levels. E.g. search for certain finds and union them
                            with the results for certain types of burials.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Not</b> excludes the first result from the new search. For example if
                            your first result was a search for all finds with a maintype
                            "jewelry" and your "not" search will be for all cemeteries that have
                            the maintype "inhumation cemetery" this will result in all inhumation
                            cemeteries that do not contain jewelry finds.
                            If your first search was on the cemetery level for the maintype of
                            "churchyard" and your "not" search will be for burials that are
                            classified with "sex" is "female" you will get all female burials
                            that were not found in churchyards.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        You can also combine an already combined search with a combined
                        search with all possibilities described above.

                        attributes.
                        They are divided into four different "type" classes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Classifications:</b> Each entity of a certain level (site, grave, burial and find) is
                            defined by one functional type
                            that explains what the entity represents. Eg. "Inumation cemetery" as classification of a
                            site or "Sword" as
                            classifictaion for a find.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Standard:</b> Properties of non archaeological entities (e.g. file license, type of
                            publications)
                        </li>
                        <li><b>User defined:</b> Categories defined in the backend by users who enter data and want to
                            "tag" archaeological entities
                            with them.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Value types:</b> "Tags" that are additionally linked with a certain value and a unit
                            (e.g. dimensions, weight,
                            measurements, count)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The <b>Vocabulary</b> page lists all contained types and gives an overview on their hierarchy,
                        usage and linked entities.
                        Selecting the respective tab displays the top level types that are available. You can expand
                        them by clicking the heading.
                        Here you find further information and the type hierarchy.

                    <h3>Data Model</h3>
                    <p>
                        The THANADOS data is structured in a four level hierarchy (site, grave,
                        burial and
                        find). The site respectively the <b>cemetery</b> itself is the superior unit
                        and works as a data
                        container for all subunits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the second level the observed archaeological features the <b>graves</b>
                        are dealt with. They
                        are again a data container for information on connected stratigraphic units,
                        in our case the
                        <b>burials</b>, which are in turn a container for further data on
                        physical objects, here the individual <b>finds</b>, assigned to the
                        respective burials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All those entities, whether sites, graves, burials or finds are of course
                        associated with
                        certain other information, thus, they can each be opened as <a
                            href="#entity">detailed view</a>
                        page, all structured in the same way, as explained above.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, if a stratigraphic unit contains osteology data for individual bones, these can be recorded e.g. as
                        single bones with specific properties like pathologies, preservation etc. A skeleton/burial
                        therefore can be a container of the bones it comprises. This way various attributes that apply
                        not to the whole skeleton but only to parts of it can be differentiated down to the level of
                        each single bone.

                        THANADOS' GeoJSONs can be used in common GIS software as well as in
                        web-mapping environments etc.
                        Their spatial reference system is WGS 84 (EPSG 4326).
