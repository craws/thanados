                        </li>
                        <li><b>Material:</b> Filter for certain materials that the entity consists
                            of. You can also define a minimum and maximum (weight percentage) like
                            between 90% and 100% copper that the respective entity should have.
                        </li>

                        respective category. This is achieved via a hierarchical property tree. You
                        can expand the tree branches by clicking the triangle button left to the
                        property name. Also you can enter the search term in the text box on top.
                        Click on <b>select</b> once the desired node has been clicked. Selecting one
                        property in the tree will also include all sub-properties of this very
                        category in your search results. E.g. choosing "Attack Weapons" in the
                        "maintype" selection for finds will also include all entries
                        like "Swords", "Arrowheads" etc. for your search result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you filter by <b>dimensions</b> you can select the respective dimension
                        from a dropdown and then define the minimum and maximum values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you filter by <b>timespan</b> you can define the minimum and maximum
                        years (CE). For years before year 0 just prepend a minus " - " to the
                        number.

                    <p>
                        Once your search delivers results, this is displayed in the search dialog.
                        Also if there are no results for your parameters.
                        Now you can inspect the list of results

                        The <b>filter/select</b> menu on the top opens a list with all sites that
                        contain at least one grave.
                        Here you can select certain cemeteries by clicking on the respective switch
                        to the left. By default ten cemeteries among
                        those with the highest number of graves are selected.
                        The switch in the header of the table turns all sites on/off.

                        You can filter the list by entering text (e.g. names or categories) into the
                        <b>search field</b>
                        and by adjusting the “begin” and “end” timespans of the respective sites
                        with the <b>time sliders</b>.
                        Furthermore, you also can sort the site list by clicking the header. Please
                        note that filtering the table (e.g by using the
                        time sliders or search categories) will hide sites from the table even if
                        they are selected. Hidden entries that are selected
                        will stay selected until they are switched of.

                        The degrees refer to the deviation of the grave from north. For this

                        of the gravepit is regarded, not that of the burials inside.
                        Thus only a deviation ranging from 0 to 180 degrees is given here.
                        The azimuth is automatically calculated using PostGIS

                    <p>
                    On the search page you can carry out searches within all cemeteries that
                    are available in the database (intersite search).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first step you can select the level on which you want to search:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Cemeteries:</b> all properties connected to the cemetery (e.g.
                        classification, timespan, evidence etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Graves:</b> all properties connected to a grave (e.g. length,
                        height/depth, azimuth, grave construction etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Burials:</b> all properties connected to a burial (e.g.
                        anthropology, sex, orientation of the skeleton)
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Finds:</b> all properties connected to the finds (e.g. types,
                        material, dimensions, position of find in grave etc.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The next step lets you choose the criteria you want to search for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Maintype:</b> Filter for the main classification of the entity</li>
                    <li><b>Properties:</b> All "type" like properties and attributes aside from
                        the main type that are connected to the entity.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Timespan:</b> Lets you define a time range filter with and earliest
                        begin and latest end between which the entity has its chronological
                        range
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Dimensions:</b> Filter for certain dimensions (minimum and maximum)
                        that the respective entity has.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Material:</b> Filter for certain materials that the entity consists
                        of. You can also define a minimum and maximum (weight percentage) like
                        between 90% and 100% copper that the respective entity should have.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Value properties:</b> Filter for certain properties that are
                        connected with a value. E.g. the property "maximum age" of
                        an individual that ranges between two user defined values.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                </div>
                <p>
                    If you select <b>maintype</b>, <b>properties</b>, <b>material</b> or <b>value
                    properties</b> another dialog will open that allows you to select the
                    respective category. This is achieved via a hierarchical property tree. You
                    can expand the tree branches by clicking the triangle button left to the
                    property name. Also you can enter the search term in the text box on top.
                    Click on <b>select</b> once the desired node has been clicked. Selecting one
                    property in the tree will also include all sub-properties of this very
                    category in your search results. E.g. choosing "Attack Weapons" in the
                    "maintype" selection for finds will also include all entries
                    like "Swords", "Arrowheads" etc. for your search result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you filter by <b>dimensions</b> you can select the respective dimension
                    from a dropdown and then define the minimum and maximum values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you filter by <b>timespan</b> you can define the minimum and maximum
                    years (CE). For years before year 0 just prepend a minus " - " to the
                    number.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once your search delivers results, this is displayed in the search dialog.
                    Also if there are no results for your parameters.
                    Now you can inspect the list of results
                    <i class="btn-secondary btn-sm fas fa-list"></i> (where you can also
                    download the results as CSV list file), add the search results as layer to
                    the map <i class="btn-secondary btn-sm fas fa-map-marked"></i>,
                    or add another combined search
                    <i class="btn-secondary btn-sm fas fa-plus"></i>
                    that will result in an intersection of the existing search results and your
                    new parameters. You can also reset your search anytime by clicking
                    <i class="btn-secondary btn-sm fas fa-sync-alt"></i>.

                    <h3>Data Model</h3>
                    <p>
                        The THANADOS data is structured in a four level hierarchy (site, grave,
                        burial and
                        find). The site respectively the <b>cemetery</b> itself is the superior unit
                        and works as a data
                        container for all subunits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the second level the observed archaeological features the <b>graves</b>
                        are dealt with. They
                        are again a data container for information on connected stratigraphic units,
                        in our case the
                        <b>burials</b>, which are in turn a container for further data on
                        physical objects, here the individual <b>finds</b>, assigned to the
                        respective burials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All those entities, whether sites, graves, burials or finds are of course
                        associated with
                        certain other information, thus, they can each be opened as <a
                            href="#entity">detailed view</a>
                        page, all structured in the same way, as explained above.
